## About Me
***

I started my professional career in the hospitality sphere. While holding the position of administrator, I received guests and coordinated the work of junior staff in the hotel.

Over time, I moved to the logistics industry, where I work as an economist until now.

Not so long ago I became interested in website development, because this industry provides countless opportunities for professional growth, with a large number of high-quality resources for self-learning and development. I have a great desire and intention to master the field of website development and become a highly qualified front-end developer.

__Colour Association from CODEWARS.__
*Colour plays an important role in our lifes. Most of us like this colour better then another. User experience specialists believe that certain colours have 
certain psychological meanings for us.
You are given a 2D array, composed of a colour and its 'common' association in 
each array element. The function you will write needs to return the colour as 'key' and association as its 'value'.*
```
function colourAssociation(array){
  
 let result = [];
 for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  result.push(  {[array[i][0]]: array[i][1]}  );
 }
  return result;
}

console.log(colourAssociation([["white", "goodness"], ["blue", "tranquility"]]));
```
