## About Me
***

I started my professional career in the hospitality sphere. While holding the position of administrator, I received guests and coordinated the work of junior staff in the hotel.

Over time, I moved to the logistics industry, where I work as an economist until now.

Not so long ago I became interested in website development, because this industry provides countless opportunities for professional growth, with a large number of high-quality resources for self-learning and development. I have a great desire and intention to master the field of website development and become a highly qualified front-end developer.
